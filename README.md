## was going to write hello world but that's too cliche

hey, i'm shahzain - i like to think of myself as a 10x dev but given how many times i've taken down prod that's closer to 0.1x lol

i work as a software engineer at barclays in the uk - building and maintaining full-stack compliance tooling for the bank. i kinda funnelled myself into the whole webdev javascript redditor engineer from when i was a kid — something about building websites really intriguied me (probably from my background as a roblox dev). now that ai has taken my job, i'm trying (unsucessfully so far) to pivot to low-level systems engineering.

you'll probably see various side projects prefixed with "kyro", that was my digital alias, if you will, when i was a kid scared of getting doxxed. i like building things that solve real, tangible problems. for example, i briefly attempted to start my own airline because i saw a gap; i built a full education saas because my school was struggling with their current one. i guess i have the 10x mentality but the 0.1x execution — working on it

if you got to this point despite the em dashes (which i did plant, because come on who can't be bothered to write their own readme) then you **must** have my socials and get in touch:
